# ID-Card-detector-and-alert-system
This project is an ID Card Detection System built with TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, utilizing Streamlit for a simple user interface. It classifies real-time video frames into "with ID" and "without ID" categories and plays an alert sound when an ID card is not detected.
